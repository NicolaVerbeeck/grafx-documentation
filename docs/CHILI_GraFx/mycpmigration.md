# Migration from My CHILI publish

## Migrate?

Your account was part of the My CHILI publish portal. 

CHILI GraFx is a platform, and is capable of hosting applications. And next to hosting applications, the platform also offers the opportunity to have resources shared amongst applications.

Therefore your account(s) need to migrate from MyCP to CHILI GraFx.
