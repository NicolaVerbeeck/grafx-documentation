# Understanding Renders in GraFx Publisher

GraFx Publisher utilizes "renders" as a measurement of use, calculated based on the type of output. Renders are counted during server-side processing:

- **Static Digital Image**: One render per image.
- **Static Digital PDF**: One render per PDF.
- **Static PDFs with Variable Data**: Counted differently, based on [specific formulas](/CHILI-GraFx/concepts/renders/#static-pdf-output).

CHILI GraFx operates under a fair use policy, allowing occasional excess in monthly render quotas. Consistent overages suggest the addition of render packs.
