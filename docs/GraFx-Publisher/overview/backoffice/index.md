# GraFx Publisher Backoffice Overview

The Backoffice in GraFx Publisher is a comprehensive management hub, featuring various elements essential for smart template creation:

- **View Preferences**: This section allows managing view preferences. More details to follow.
- **3D Models and Folding**: A section for managing 3D models and folding setups, which are planned for deprecation in future versions.
- **Settings**: Users can create and manage settings here, like barcode types, to streamline their use in Smart Templates.
