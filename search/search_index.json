This allows you to create PDFs that are optimized to efficiently download, transfer, and process with your specific production workflows in mind. Before version 2022, the only way to optimize your generated PDFs was to use one of the available quality settings, a custom Image Conversion Profile or Ghostscript optimization commands: Now all of this has been replaced by some brand new settings that let you control the image downsampling, the image compression and whether you want to include the complete images or only the visible parts. You can also choose to convert the colors of all objects in the PDF to a specific destination profile. This means that you cannot use an Image Conversion Profile for PDF output anymore. They are only used for image output from now on. \u26a0\ufe0f Your existing PDF Export Settings will be mapped automatically to one of the new image quality presets. If you want to use a different preset or customize the settings to your needs, please go to your Backoffice and check out the new PDF Export Settings. Note To see if you are ready, check out this article: Are You Ready For Version 2022? Image downsampling and compression You can choose one of the available image quality presets if you want to optimize your PDF for high quality output or for small file size or to keep your images in the original quality. If this doesn't suit your needs, you can customize as you want. You can configure how the image downsampling and compression should work for different types of images: color, grayscale and monochrome. Remove invisible image data You can crop out all the image data in the PDF that is invisible after the images are fitted into frames. This can significantly reduce the file size of the PDF without any visible difference. Convert colors In the PDF Export Settings there is a new \"Convert Colors\" setting in the \"Standards & Output\" section (previously this section was called \"Standards\"). It enables you to convert the colors of all objects in the PDF to a destination color profile. If you don't specify an Output PDF Standard, you have to choose a destination profile for color conversion. If you do specify an Output PDF Standard, you also have to specify the Output Intent. In this case the Output Intent is used as destination profile for color conversion. Transparent PNG output It is now possible to generate transparent PNG images! In the Image Conversion Profiles settings you can set the \"Background Color\" for PNG output to \"Transparent\" or to a specific RGB color, in case you want to replace the transparency by a color. Please note that the \"Padding Color\" setting has been renamed to \"Background Color,\" because it is used both for padding (if \"Scaling\" is set to \"Exact\") and as background color for the transparent parts of the PNG image (for all \"Scaling\" options). \u26a0\ufe0f Up until now, if your Image Conversion Profile had \"Padding Color\" set to \"Transparent\", your PNG images were generated with a white background. If you don't change anything they will have a transparent background from now on. If you still want to have a white background, you have to set the \"Background Color\" to white instead of transparent. \u26a0\ufe0f The \"Transparent\" option for \"Padding Color\" has been removed for JPEG output. Existing Image Conversion Profiles that use transparent padding for JPEG output will use white as padding color instead. If you want transparent padding you have to use PNG output, where you can set the \"Background Color\" to \"Transparent\". Note To see if you are ready, check out this article: Are You Ready For Version 2022? Overprint simulation You can now generate images that simulate the effects of overprint in a PDF document, by enabling \"Simulate Overprinting\" in the Image Conversion Profiles. Overprint can be applied to text or to a frame border or fill, but PDF assets can also contain overprint. With this feature enabled you can have a more reliable validation workflow, since the generated image will show you how the PDF document with overprint will look like when it is printed. Example 1: The \"WATER\" text is set to overprint to compensate for misregistration on a press. If you look closely at the bottom image, you can see that the black text is darker when printed on top of the water. Without overprint simulation With overprint simulation Example 2: The \"spicy\" text is set to overprint to create an effect of the background items showing through the text, as you can see on the bottom image. Without overprint simulation With overprint simulation Changes to image output With this version of CHILI publisher Online, we are using a new, state-of-the-art technology to generate images from PDFs. While this offers a lot of improvements and new features, as the ones mentioned above, it can also cause small differences in the image output, when compared to previous versions. Besides that, one of the side effects of this new technology is that we had to replace the 1-100 numeric \"Jpeg Quality\" setting by 5 new options to define the image quality of the JPEG output: \u201cMinimum,\" \u201cLow,\" \u201cMedium,\" \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201cMaximum\u201d. Existing Image Conversion Profiles will be mapped automatically to one of the new options.

But they are special animals, equipped with Sonar to navigate. A very effective yet simple tool. Some people are scared of bats, due to the appearance in horror movies. And they sleep upside down\u2026 We will use \u201cBats\u201d to help you simplify your templates. CHILI publisher is a template building engine to enable one smart template to output multiple variants of the same document. How to get the most out of the smart template, without overdoing it? The Formula: Formula B(ATS){*} Translated to people who have less affection with regex: Build template - (Add 1 type of logic - Test - Simplify) {repeat until happy} Desktop Probably, your smart template journey starts on your desktop. If not, you can skip this step to \"Build your template\". Conversion The conversion itself is not the challenge. But it\u2019s \u201cWhat\u201d you convert. Reducing the complexity before conversion will greatly benefit the quest to simplicity. Imagine a design with a few thousand vector elements, used as a background for a design. When converting, these elements will be converted to vector elements, to be calculated individually to show in your browser window. If these elements will remain background items, and will not change with any variant, you can increase simplicity by combining all these elements into 1 vector layer and place this layer as an asset. Tip Simplify: Combine background elements into 1 placed asset Build your template Your document is now ready to be made smart(er). At this stage, you have a blank document in CHILI publisher, or you have converted a document form your desktop application. Either way, it\u2019s time to start adding Logic to the document, to make it smart. B(ATS){*} We have arrived at the recurring theme of the formula (ATS){*}. Add 1 type of Logic Test the result Simplify {*} Repeat Add Logic The art of adding logic to your document is the core of CHILI publisher. Enabling 1 smart template to create several types of output. This means, that the logic added to your template has the power to change the output, depending on the circumstances. Imagine a campaign for CHILL water, for several sport types. A database feeds To make a document smarter, several tools are at your disposal. Tip Add one logic layer and test Unlike the basic human rights, not all logic is created equal. Some types of logic will have more impact on the cost of processing the variant. Adding a single variable, to a one page document (like a Business Card) is less \u201cexpensive\u201d than let\u2019s say an anchored frame, that holds several variable in itself, combined with auto-grow. Example Frame1 will auto-grow, according to more content added Frame2 is anchored, to Frame1, and will refer to its bottom coordinates. So, when more content is added, Frame1 grows, and Frame2 will move down. These are 3 calculations to be coordinated. Variables Auto-grow Anchoring Each layer of logic will add complexity, and make the document \u201cheavier\u201d to calculate the output. Tip Add 1 layer at a time Test When you added 1 layer of automation logic, test the output. How can you test? That will differ according to your setup. If you setup allow the interaction with an end-user to fill in the variable, look for challenging variable content. What is the shortest word, what is the longest variant? Maybe your setup containts a datasource, that will auto populate the variables. Best to check the shortest and longest variable. Does the datasource contain special characters? Tip check variable input with a pre-set of test content (long, short, special characters) What is your output? Check digital output, with or without variable Check print / pdf output, with and without variables Check output with datasources Simplify When you test is successful, now is a good time to think about simplification, before adding more automation logic. E.g. You can add a frame anchor to the left and bottom of another frame. In the picture, you see Frame2 is anchored to 2 targets. Frame2 is anchored to the bottom, where the top of Frame2 is anchored to the bottom of Frame1, with an offset of 5mm. Frame2 is anchored to the left side of Frame1, without offset. Nothing wrong with this setup, but the left of Frame 1 is never changing. So, the second anchor of Frame2 is unnecessary. And it would mean a 4th calculation, where only 3 are necessary. This is a easy simplification, than can save processing time. Even when it only saves a few microseconds, this would be multiplied by Amount of outputs (1 digital / 2 print) Amount of records in a Data Source (e.g. 1M) This add up to: 5 microseconds x 2 million = 10 million microseconds = 166 minutes. Tip think volume when you create your template. Bigger variant runs, bigger savings Repeat You created your document (manually or through conversion), you Added logic, you tested and you simplified. Time to repeat, add more logic, test and simplify. {*} is a reference to Regular Expressions. Where the asterisk refers to \u201cinfinite\u201d times. You can always improve! Tip never stop improving, keep repeating to find better solutions Template building is not an exact science Since template logic is calculated by a computer, the outcome should be very predictable. But, templates are created by humans. Humans are creative architects of solutions. Every outcome has several ways to get there. Ask 2 colleagues to make the same smart template, they will both find different approaches. That\u2019s why template building is not an exact science. Add to that the several possible layers of complexity, and amount of data being output through datasources, and you might run into unexpected behaviour. That\u2019s why follow the BATS approach gives you the best possible outcome. Document your steps, so you can always return one step to re-test. If the outcome is not what is supposed to happen, then it\u2019s time to call in the troops, and inform us you may have found an exceptions. You could submit a support ticket with the Client Success team, or you could ask for specialist help. Our service partners have trained staff to help you with the template building journey. Tip document every step of your building process, so you can back-trace Cost weight Below is an attempt to list features that will make your template smarter. Some features have more impact on complexity than other. This table gives you an insight in less and more taxing features.

Imagine a design with a few thousand vector elements, used as a background for a design. When converting, these elements will be converted to vector elements, to be calculated individually to show in your browser window.

Tip Add one logic layer and test Unlike the basic human rights, not all logic is created equal. Some types of logic will have more impact on the cost of processing the variant.

Nothing wrong with this setup, but the left of Frame 1 is never changing. So, the second anchor of Frame2 is unnecessary. And it would mean a 4th calculation, where only 3 are necessary. This is a easy simplification, than can save processing time. Even when it only saves a few microseconds, this would be multiplied by Amount of outputs (1 digital / 2 print) Amount of records in a Data Source (e.g. 1M) This add up to: 5 microseconds x 2 million = 10 million microseconds = 166 minutes.
